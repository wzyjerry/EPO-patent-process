<heading id="h0001"><b>[Technical Field]</b></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a tracking-type window blind apparatus using solar modules. More particularly, the tracking-type window blind apparatus operates sunshades to which the solar module is attached or not, based on an operation mode, a current season and time, and a solar altitude angle. The tracking-type window blind apparatus individually controls the distance between sunshades or the inclination angle of sunshades.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>[Background Art]</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Photovoltaics (PV) do not require any particular maintenance and simply produces electricity using sunlight without pollution and corrosion of materials. There are various applications of PV. The technologies for building integration for using PV as exterior finishing materials have been in developing actively around the world.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">In particular, building components that can be applied to integrate PV modules are very diverse, including curtain walls, ceilings, vehicles, PV roof tiles, and transparent PV windows. Depending on the characteristics, it can be used in natural light and vehicles, thus improve the overall energy saving effect, comfort, and economic feasibility of the building.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">A building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system utilizes a location where<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> sunlight enters the building and thus may have a structure that is combined with building components such as roofs, windows, exterior finishing materials, and the like. In particular, it is advantageous in that the structure is easy to integrate into a building, and the direction in which the incidence of sunlight can be traced is changed.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Accordingly, a solar photovoltaic window blind system that can combine shading and solar power by combining solar cell panels on sun shading plates or slats of a window blind system installed from outside to inside or from inside to outside has been proposed.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">In general, if the PV window blind system is installed in a large-scale building with outer walls covered with glass, considerable renewable energy production and savings can be expected.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">The PV window blind system requires a solar tracking function that follows an incident direction of sunlight to maximize solar power generation. Depending on a tracking method, the PV window blind system can be classified into a program tracking-type system and a sensor tracking-type system. The program tracking method stores and tracks the optimum sun position according to the year, month, and day using a computer or a microprocessor having a program for tracking the movement trajectory of the sun during the year. The sensor tracking method tracks the maximum incident amount using a sensor. The error may occur depending on the type and shape of the sensor.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">Depending on a tracking direction, it can be classified into a slope single-axis (or horizontal single-axis) tracking system and a dual-axis tracking system. One axis of the dual-axis tracking system may trace the azimuth of the sun, and the other axis may trace an altitude angle of the sun. The slope single-axis tracking system is a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> system in which the axis is set at a constant inclination angle in the north-south direction and is rotated around the axis to track the sun. In the case of the slope single-axis tracking system, a power generation amount can be increased by only about 1 %, even if tracking is done by the sensor method.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">However, due to the nature of the window blind system, facing in the direction of the sun does not necessarily maximize the generation amount. For example, if the blind slates are toward the direction of the sun when the sun is at its meridian altitude in the mid-summer, the blind slats may be placed to be almost horizontal, and thus most areas of the blind slates may be shaded.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">In addition, a wavelength range to which the optical sensor is sensitive is different from a wavelength range in which the actual power generation amount is high, and thus the identified sun direction does not necessarily guarantee the highest power generation. Furthermore, if the weather conditions are not good, a malfunction is inevitable. Accordingly, it is not cost-effective.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">Solar power generation is most efficient when an angle (line) of a sunshade and a solar altitude angle (line) are orthogonal. In a general blind-type PV device, a distance between sunshades is one time "a width of the sunshade". For preventing shading by an adjacent sunshade, an inclination angle that makes the angle of the sunshade and the solar altitude angle perpendicular to each other should be smaller than 90°. Thus, in order to practically prevent shading, the inclination angle of the sunshade and the solar altitude angle forms an angle about 14° to 76° during most of the power generation time, and thus they are not orthogonal. Accordingly, the effect of the solar tracking device is greatly reduced.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">As a prior art, a distance between slats is fixed at a manufacturing stage that<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> louver has a fixed distance and blinds are withdrawn or overlapped with the fixed space. There was no variable simultaneous spacing means for distance between the slates to solve the shading problem between slats. More specifically, in a prior art, the distance between the slates may be controlled only by overlapping slats or withdrawing the slates. The lowest end in case of a prior horizontal blind system is sequentially pulled to adjust the spaces between the slates, and accordingly, the distances between the slats cannot be variably adjusted while operating the slats.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">When the distance between slats is widened, no shading may occur between the slats, light enters through space between the slats at noon. Therefore the window blind having the wide distance between slats cannot provide sufficient the shading and the lighting. In order to maintain the natural shading and the lighting of the blind, it is possible to attach the solar modules partially to the areas where the slates or louvers do not shade. However, there is a problem to make the attached area of the solar cell reduced.</p>

<p id="p0019" num="0019">The plurality of sunshades may include at least one sunshade for power generation having the solar module, and at least one sunshade for privacy protection disposed to be adjacent to a lo7wer end of the sunshade for power generation. The sunshade for privacy protection may not have the solar module. A distance between adjacent sunshades in the plurality of sunshades may be a predetermined multiple of a width of the sunshade.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">When the set operation mode is the power generation mode and the solar altitude angle is smaller than a predetermined altitude angle, the controller may control the inclination angle of the sunshades to be perpendicular to the solar altitude angle and may control the distance between the sunshades to be a predetermined multiple of the width of the sunshade.</p>

Problems in sun shielding, lighting, and shading in sunshades can be solved. Thereby sunlight power generation is optimized.</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">According to the exemplary embodiments, a solar altitude angle, a distance between sunshades, and an inclination angle of the sunshades are adjusted in a power generation mode. Since the angle (line) of the sunshade and the solar altitude angle (line) meet almost close to be perpendicular vertical, shading between sunshades are prevented. It improves power generation efficiency. In addition, it varies entering of direct or indirect sunlight to the room seasonally, to adjust indoor brightness and an indoor temperature.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">In addition, according to the exemplary embodiments an angle of sunshades and a distance between adjacent sunshades can be automatically and manually adjusted depending on a solar altitude angle.</p>

<p id="p0032" num="0032">According to the exemplary embodiments, problems in sun shielding, lighting, and shading in sunshades can be solved, while maintaining an angle formed by an inclination angle (line) of the sunshade and a solar altitude angle (line) to be close to perpendicular during most of time that power generation mode is available. Thereby power generation efficiency is optimized. That is, the exemplary embodiments are economic and effective since they satisfy the above-stated conditions and thus power generation efficiency can be more improved compared to a prior art.</p>

The driver 130 may adjust a distance between the respective sunshades 120 or may adjust neighboring sunshades 120 to be overlapped with each other by changing an angle of each sunshade 120 or moving each sunshade 120.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">Meanwhile, the controller 140 sets one operation mode among a power generation mode, a privacy protection mode, and a lighting mode according to a user's command, and controls an inclination angle of sunshades and a distance between sunshades, according to the set operation mode, a current season and time, and a comparison result of a solar altitude angle and a predetermined altitude angle (e.g., 60°). Here, the predetermined altitude angle is not limited to a specific angle, i.e., 60°, and can be variously modified.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">An operation for controlling the inclination angle of sunshades and the distance between sunshades will now be described in detail. When the predetermined operation mode is the power generation mode and the solar altitude angle is smaller than the predetermined altitude angle, the controller 140 controls the sunshade inclination angle to be perpendicular to the solar altitude angle and controls the distance between the sunshades 120 to be a multiple of the width of the sunshade 120.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">In addition, when the predetermined operation mode is the highest level (e.g., the first level) in the privacy protection mode, the controller 140 controls an inclination angle of sunshades to be in a completely closed or shielded state and controls the distance between the sunshades to be the width of the sunshade.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">Meanwhile, when the predetermined operation mode is the lower level (e.g., the second level) in the privacy protection mode and the solar altitude angle is smaller than the predetermined altitude angle, the controller 140 controls the sunshade inclination angle to be perpendicular to the solar altitude and controls the distance between the sunshades to not let sunlight directly entered through the sunshades 120.</p>

<p id="p0049" num="0049">When the solar altitude angle exceeds the predetermined altitude angle regardless of the operation mode of the window blind apparatus 100, the controller 140 controls the inclination angle of the sunshades to prevent shading of the sunshades and controls the distance between the sunshades to be a predetermined multiple of the width<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> of the sunshade.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">The user interface 150 receives the user command from a user. Here, the user interface 150 can receive the user command through a user terminal, a remote controller, and the like, which can be manipulated by the user. Thus, the user interface 150 may include a communication module for receiving of the user command through the user terminal or the remote controller. In addition, the user interface 150 may further include an input-output module for directly receiving a user command from the user or outputting a result of the user command or a current state.</p>
<p id="p0051" num="0051">The data storage 160 stores data for controlling the sunshades 120 where the solar module 110 is attached in the tracking-type window blind apparatus 100.</p>
<p id="p0052" num="0052">Meanwhile, the user can manually operate the tracking-type window blind apparatus 100 instead of using a programming control method. Seasons may be divided into 24 or 12 divisions, and thus the user may manually adjust the inclination angle of the sunshades 120 and the distance between the sunshades once or twice per month.</p>
<p id="p0053" num="0053">Such a manual operation does not require additional power. In addition, manufacturing cost of a tracking-type window blind apparatus providing manual operation can be more inexpensive compared to a tracking-type window blind apparatus 100 that cannot be manually operated. Compared to an automatically operated tracking-type window blind apparatus, a tracking-type window blind apparatus that can be manually operated has a relatively simple structure, thereby saving time and cost required for consumer service in case of failure.</p>

<p id="p0055" num="0055">A tracking-type window blind apparatus 100 according to the first exemplary embodiment can control an angle and a distance of sunshades 121 for power generation and sunshades 122 for privacy protection depending on seasons, times, and operation modes. That is, such a tracking-type window blind apparatus 100 automatically adjusts a distance and an angle of the sunshades 121 for power generation and the sunshades 122 for privacy protection based on seasons and times.</p>
<p id="p0056" num="0056">As operating the sunshades 121 for power generation, the tracking-type window blind apparatus 100 controls a distance between the sunshades 121 and an inclination angle of the sunshades 121 for power generation to be almost perpendicular to the solar altitude angle, by setting an actual operation value on program.</p>
<p id="p0057" num="0057">The tracking-type window blind apparatus 100 receives a user command through a remote controller or a user terminal and sets a corresponding operation mode, and controls an inclination angle of the sunshades and a distance between sunshades according to the set operation mode, a current season and time, and a solar altitude angle.</p>
<p id="p0058" num="0058">Thus, the tracking-type window blind apparatus 100 may control the sunshade distance to be two times a width of the sunshade in a general power generation mode. In addition, the tracking-type window blind apparatus 100 operates in a privacy protection mode by using the sunshades 122 provided for privacy protection.</p>
<p id="p0059" num="0059">The tracking-type window blind apparatus 100 may have various operation modes, and selection of an operation mode can be carried by using a remote controller.</p>
<p id="p0060" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the tracking-type window blind apparatus 100 includes at least one sunshade 121 for power generation and at least one sunshade 122 for privacy<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> protection. The sunshade 121 for power generation has solar module 110 attached and a distance to an adjacent sunshades is a predetermined multiple of a width of the sunshade. The sunshades 122 for privacy protection are disposed of adjacent to a lower end of the sunshades 121 for power generation. The solar module is not attached to the sunshades 122 for privacy protection.</p>
<p id="p0061" num="0061">For example, the number of sunshades 122 for privacy protection may be more than one time the number of sunshades 121 for power generation.</p>
<p id="p0062" num="0062">When the tracking-type window blind apparatus 100 is in the power generation mode, the controller 140 may control the driver 130 to adjust the distance between the sunshades 121 for power generation to be two times the width of the sunshade 121.</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">In this case, when the distance between the sunshades 121 for power generation is two times the width of the sunshade 121, the tracking-type window blind apparatus 100 can prevent shading between the sunshades 121, thereby optimizing power generation efficiency.</p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">Since a distance between the sunshades 121 for power generation of the tracking-type window blind apparatus 100 is wide, a temperature of the solar modules 110 can be decreased quickly by an indoor temperature even though a temperature at a surface of solar cells rises. Accordingly, deterioration of power generation efficiency due to an increased temperature of the solar modules 110 can be reduced, thereby power generation is optimized.</p>
<p id="p0065" num="0065">In addition, the tracking-type window blind apparatus 100 can easily adjust lighting and an indoor temperature. The tracking-type window blind apparatus 100 can easily assure sight and ventilation. Since the distance between the sunshades is more than two times the width of the sunshade, a user can see outside and thus feels less<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> stuffy during power generation.</p>
<p id="p0066" num="0066">In this case, according to the exemplary embodiment, lighting and privacy protection are not sufficiently effective, and thus additional shading blind, double structure shading, or a curtain for privacy protection may be required for complete lighting and privacy protection.</p>
<p id="p0067" num="0067">However, in the tracking-type window blind apparatus 100, a distance between the sunshades is reduced to one time the width of the sunshade by using the sunshades 122 to which the solar module 110 is not attached, to thereby reinforce lighting and privacy protection. That is, in the tracking-type window blind apparatus 100, the sunshades 122 for privacy protection, disposed adjacent to a lower end of the sunshades 121 for power generation, are sequentially moved in a direction where the sunshades 121 for power generation are disposed, and a distance between sunshades 121 and a distance between sunshades 122 are respectively reduced to block sunlight.</p>
<p id="p0068" num="0068">Here, the sunshades 121 having solar modules 110 attached may be separated, in order to prevent a problem in power generation even through a horizontal side of the sunshades 121 away from a window is shaded.</p>

<p id="p0216" num="0216">In Table 2, according to the Conventional blind-type PV device, the Viewable view at 60° is 0.13 that a solar altitude angle is low in winter and thus an inclination<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> angle □b1 of the slat is set to be over 60° in sunlight generation so that a view is very poor.</p>
<p id="p0217" num="0217">The percentage of sight required to view according to the present disclosure is over 4.38 times at 60° that a viewing angle (amount of sunshine and lighting) required for sunshine and a view in winter can be effectively assured, and since space heating accounts for 55 % of the energy consumption in residential buildings, competitiveness of the tracking-type window blind apparatus according to the present disclosure can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p0218" num="0218">The tracked window blind apparatus according to the present disclosure can provide a good view and lighting during four seasons, and thus can optimize the room temperature control regardless of solar power generation. When the inclination angle of the sunshades □b2 of the second region is 0° (□b2 = 0°), an area around a latitude of 36° (Cheongju, Republic of Korea) having four distinct seasons was applied.</p>

<p id="p0221" num="0221">In Table 3, the percentage of sight required to view according to the present disclosure is about 0.4 times on average that since it is summer, narrower viewing angles mean that direct sunlight and scattered light are not introduced into the room, and accordingly, it is advantageous for proper room temperature control (cool state maintenance).</p>
<p id="p0222" num="0222">When the inclination angle of the sunshades ∠b2 of the second region b2 is set to - 90°, not only direct sunlight but also unnecessary scattered light in summer can be blocked, thereby enhancing the effect of lowering the room temperature and the sensible temperature. Thus, in a time zone near a slat inclination angle ∠b1 of 60° time inclination angle of the second region b2 is changed to 90e and thus the viewing capability can be improved by increasing a viewing angle ratio from 0.07 to 0.5, while blocking almost all direct sunlight.</p>
<p id="p0223" num="0223">Meanwhile, Table 4 shows the comparison of a view and indoor temperature control capability (viewing angle) in spring and fall according to a type of a PV device.

<p id="p0225" num="0225">When the inclination angle □b2 of the second region b2 is set to 90°, direct sunlight in spring and autumn is blocked, while allowing necessary scattered light to enter the room properly, and accordingly, the room temperature, the view, and the illumination can be kept in the optimal condition. However, when the slat inclination angle □b2 of the second region b2 is changed to 0° according to a user's preference and environment (i.e., room temperature, a user optimum temperature, a view, and light), a viewing angle ratio is increased from 2.2 times to 2.7 times such that viewing capability can be improved while increasing a room temperature. However, in such a case, an amount of direct sunlight introduced to the room is hardly changed and an amount of scattered light introduced into the room is increased. Accordingly, a user needs to properly select a slat inclination angle □b1.</p>

<p id="p0228" num="0228">When the inclination angle □b2 of the second region b2 is set to 0°, direct sunlight in winter can be partially blocked, while allowing necessary scattered light to enter the room as much as possible.
