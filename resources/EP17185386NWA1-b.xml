        <heading id="h0001"><b><u>Field of the Invention</u></b></heading>
        <p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention belongs to the field of automated in vitro diagnostic sample
            processing. Within this field, it relates to a laboratory instrument, a laboratory system and a method for
            adjusting the positioning of pipetting devices or handling devices of laboratory instruments or laboratory
            systems in order to ensure accuracy and safety of certain sample processing steps.</p>
        <heading id="h0002"><b><u>Background</u></b></heading>
        <p id="p0002" num="0002">In diagnostic laboratories, automated pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical
            laboratory instruments are used for various sample processing steps to produce accurate and reliable test
            results which represent pivotal information for physicians. Typically, such laboratory instruments are
            equipped with consumables, sample processing devices, waste containers, sample racks, and reagent racks
            which are accommodated in dedicated units assembled on a working surface within the laboratory instrument.
            Thus, the interior and the working surface of a laboratory instrument are built with a plurality of units
            and construction components which must be precisely adapted to one another for being assembled.</p>
        <p id="p0003" num="0003">For a reliable and safe operation, such laboratory instruments have to be well
            maintained. The different components and the working surface of the laboratory instrument have to be cleaned
            on a regular basis to avoid cross contaminations which can lead to erroneous test results. The thorough
            cleaning of the interior of the laboratory instrument also ensures the safety of the operator and extends
            the laboratory instrument lifetime. As the downtime of the laboratory instrument should be kept as short as
            possible, the cleaning of the laboratory instrument should be as efficient as possible. However, as
            conventional laboratory instruments comprise multiple assembled units and construction components, the
            working surface of the laboratory instrument may possess small gaps and splits which complicate the thorough
            cleaning of the interior of the laboratory instrument. Particularly, in laboratory instruments in the area
            of nucleic acid analytics
            <!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> where a highly sensitive analytical technology is used, smallest impurities may have
            severe consequences on test results and subsequent diagnosis.</p>
        <p id="p0004" num="0004">Some sample processing steps include pipetting operations like the aspiration and/or
            dispensation of liquid samples and reagents out of and/or into vessels using a pipetting device. For those
            pipetting operations an accurate positioning of the pipette device relative to the sample vessels or reagent
            vessels positioned on the working surface is important as a physical contact between the pipette tip of the
            pipetting device and the sample vessels or reagent vessels can cause sample cross-contamination, reagent
            cross-contamination, and/ or damage of the vessels or pipetting device of the laboratory instrument.
            Therefore, the positioning of the pipetting device has to be adjusted or calibrated on a regular basis.</p>

        <p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention relates to a laboratory instrument which comprises a single base
            plate comprising at least one embedded compartment. At least one of said embedded compartment is selected
            from a group consisting of an embedded consumable compartment, an embedded sample processing compartment, an
            embedded waste compartment, an embedded activation device compartment, an embedded rack receiving
            compartment, or a combination thereof.</p>
        <p id="p0012" num="0012">As used herein, the term "laboratory instrument" relates to any pre-analytical,
            analytical, or post-analytical instrument for performing sample or sample vessel processing steps. A
            pre-analytical instrument can usually be used for the preliminary processing of samples or sample vessels.
            An analytical instrument can be designed, for example, to use a sample or part of the sample and a reagent
            in order to produce a measurable signal, on the basis of which it is possible to determine whether the
            analyte is present, and if desired in what concentration. A post-analytical instrument can usually be used
            for the post-processing of samples like the archiving of samples. The pre-analytical, analytical and
            post-analytical instrument may comprise, for example, at least one device from the group of following
            devices: a sorting device for sorting samples or sample vessels, a cap removal device for removing caps or
            closures on sample vessels, a cap fitting device for fitting caps or closures on sample vessels, a pipetting
            device for pipetting a sample, an aliquoting device for aliquoting samples, a centrifuging device for
            centrifuging samples, an analyzing device for analyzing a sample, a heating device for heating a sample, a
            cooling device for cooling a sample, a mixing device for mixing a sample, a separation device for isolating
            an analyte of the sample, a storing device for storing samples, an archiving device for archiving samples, a
            sample vessel type determination device for determining a sample vessel type, a sample quality determination
            device for determining a sample quality. The laboratory instrument may comprise a three-dimensional
            rectangular coordinate system comprising a x direction, y direction, and z direction which are
            perpendicularly aligned with respect to each other, with the first and second directions (x, y) spanning a
            plane and the third direction (z) being perpendicularly aligned with respect to the plane. In one
            embodiment, the first and second directions (x, y) can span a horizontal plane and the third direction (z)
            can be vertically aligned (direction of fall). In the following description, reference is made to the three
            directions x, y, and z.
            <!-- EPO <DP n="6"> -->
        </p>
        <p id="p0013" num="0013">As used herein, the term "single base plate" relates to a plate mounted within the
            laboratory instrument which represents the actual working surface on which sample, sample vessel, reagent
            and/ or reagent vessel processing steps of the laboratory instrument are carried out. For this purpose, the
            base plate is provided with embedded compartments for accommodating consumables, sample processing devices,
            waste containers, activation devices, and racks which are required for carrying out the sample, sample
            vessel, reagent and/ or reagent vessel processing steps. The single base plate consists of one single piece
            and can be made of any suitable material with sufficient rigidity (e.g. metal and/ or plastic). The single
            base plate may have different shapes and forms to meet the requirements of the laboratory instrument.</p>
        <p id="p0014" num="0014">The term "embedded compartment" as used herein, means that the compartment and the
            single base plate consist of one single formed piece. Thus, there are no gaps or splits between the actual
            working surface and the embedded compartment which allows an efficient and thorough cleaning of the working
            surface of the laboratory instrument. The embedded compartment encompasses an inner volume and may be
            designed as recesses or protrusions of the single base plate.</p>
        <p id="p0015" num="0015">As used herein, the term "embedded consumable compartment" relates to a dedicated
            embedded compartment of the single base plate adapted for receiving, storing, and/ or releasing consumables
            used for operating a laboratory instrument. The embedded consumable compartment can be manually or
            automatically loaded/ unloaded with consumables like for example pipette tip racks, sample vessel racks,
            multiwell plates, reagent containers, reagent container racks, or reaction vessel racks.</p>
        <p id="p0016" num="0016">As used herein, the term "embedded sample processing compartment" relates to a
            dedicated embedded compartment of the single base plate adapted for mounting or accommodating one or more
            sample processing devices used for conducting sample processing steps. Examples of sample processing devices
            are heating devices, cooling devices, mixing devices, separation devices, analyzing devices, storing
            devices, or centrifugation devices.</p>
        <p id="p0017" num="0017">As used herein, the term "embedded waste compartment" relates to a dedicated embedded
            compartment of the single base plate adapted for receiving, storing, and/or releasing waste containers. The
            embedded waste compartment can be manually or automatically loaded/
            <!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> unloaded with waste containers like for example tip waste racks or waste bags used
            for disposing used consumables, samples or reagents.</p>
        <p id="p0018" num="0018">As used herein, the term "embedded activation device compartment" relates to a
            dedicated embedded compartment of the single base plate for accommodating an activation device. The term
            "activation device" as used herein relates to a stationary structure which can engage with a part of a
            moving device like a pipetting device or handling device. And the activation device can activate or change a
            specific mechanism or functionality of the moving device by means of engagement with the part of the moving
            device. An activation device may be designed as described in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO2017064089A">
                <text>WO2017/064089</text></patcit>, reference number 176 in figures 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 and
            corresponding figure descriptions.</p>
        <p id="p0019" num="0019">As used herein, the term "embedded rack receiving compartment" relates to an embedded
            compartment of the single base plate adapted for loading and unloading racks. The embedded rack receiving
            compartment can be manually or automatically loaded/ unloaded with racks like for example sample vessel
            racks or reagent container racks.</p>
        <p id="p0020" num="0020">In one embodiment of the laboratory instrument as described herein, the laboratory
            instrument comprises a housing. The housing comprises a frame and the single base plate is mounted on the
            frame within the laboratory instrument. As the housing comprises a frame configured to support the base
            plate, the housing serves also as a supporting structure. The housing may further comprise a bottom plate, a
            rear wall, two opposing side walls, a front wall, and a top wall. Thus, the interior of the laboratory
            instrument may be protected from the environment by the housing. Thereby, pollution from outside or unwanted
            access to the interior of the laboratory instrument is prevented. The front wall and/or top wall may form a
            hood which can be moved from a closed position, in which an interior of the housing is prevented from
            access, to an open position, in which the interior of the housing is exposed so as to allow access, and vice
            versa. The frame may comprise a plurality of profiles. The profiles are connected to one another. Thus, the
            frame may be designed in a modular manner as it is built up by profiles. Particularly, the use of profiles
            allows for a variety of designs and a scaled up or scaled down construction of the frame. The term "profile"
            as used herein refers to an elongated constructional member. The profiles may be made by extrusion. As such,
            the profiles may be so called extrusion profiles. The profiles may be connected to one another using
            connecting elements such
            <!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> as screws or clamps. The profiles may be made of plastics and/or metal. For example,
            the profiles are made of aluminium for a lightweight construction. As the single base plate is mounted on
            the frame, the single base plate contributes to the stability of the housing.</p>
        <p id="p0021" num="0021">In an alternative embodiment, the laboratory instrument comprises a scaffold or
            supporting structure enclosed by a laboratory instrument case which covers the interior of the laboratory
            instrument to protect it from the environment. And the single base plate is mounted on the scaffold or
            supporting structure within the laboratory instrument.</p>
        <p id="p0022" num="0022">In one embodiment of the single base plate, the single base plate is made of
            thermoplastic or duroplastic polymers which are well known in the art. By supplying energy, those polymers
            can be brought into a desired shape or form of the single base plate by various manufacturing or forming
            processes. After the single base plate has cooled, it retains its shape and form. For example, the single
            base plate is made of the thermoplastic polymer ABS GF 17 (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene with 17 % glass
            fibre) for a light and the same time stable construction.</p>
        <p id="p0023" num="0023">In a further embodiment of the single base plate, the single base plate is an injection
            molding plate. Injection molding is a manufacturing or forming process for producing a work piece like the
            single base plate by injecting material like thermoplastic or duroplastic polymers into a mold. Material for
            the single base plate is fed into a heated barrel, mixed, and forced into a mold cavity, where it cools and
            hardens to the configuration of the cavity. With injection molding almost all shapes or forms of the single
            base plate and the at least one embedded compartment which are formed as one single piece can be
            manufactured with high precision and at a low price. Among the various possible manufacturing or forming
            processes, the thermoplastic foam injection molding is well suited for the production of a single base plate
            with a certain size required for laboratory instruments.</p>
        <p id="p0024" num="0024">In an alternative embodiment, the single base plate is a 3D printer product. 3D
            printers can produce a virtually free-formable single base plate from a filament consisting of thermoplastic
            or duroplastic polymers. As no mold cavity is used for the forming process, 3D printing is well suited to
            produce small batches of single base plates.</p>
        <p id="p0025" num="0025">In one embodiment of the single base plate, the single base plate is coated with an UV
            light and reagent resistant varnish. As UV light is widely used for decontaminating the interior and working
            surfaces of laboratory instruments, the UV light resistant characteristics of the varnish
            <!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> can protect the single base plate from UV light based deteriorations. During
            operation of the laboratory instrument, the single base plate may also be exposed to various reagents (test
            reagents, elution buffers, lysis buffers, washing buffers, etc.) as sample and sample vessel processing
            steps like pipetting operations or removal/ fitting of sample vessel caps can cause splashes, droplets or
            aerosol. Thus, the base plate has to be protected from reagents as well as cleaning agents in order to
            prevent damages of the single base plate. One example of a varnish with good UV light and reagent resistant
            characteristics suitable for the single base plate is Duoplast U242.</p>
        <p id="p0026" num="0026">In one embodiment of the at least one embedded compartment, the at least one embedded
            compartment comprises rounded corners or rounded edges or a combination thereof. Thereby, no impurities can
            accumulate in corners and cleaning of the single base plate is more thorough and efficient.</p>
        <p id="p0027" num="0027">In a further embodiment of the at least one embedded compartment, the at least one
            embedded compartment comprises at least two side walls which encompass an inner volume, a bottom, and an
            open top, wherein the at least two side walls are opposite each other or adjacent each other. The side walls
            and bottom of the embedded compartment may be closed surfaces or may have one or more openings for providing
            access to the inner volume from the side or from below. Access to the inner volume from the side or below
            may be advantageous for providing the electrical power supply and/ or mounting of sample processing devices
            within a sample processing compartment. Additionally, the one or more openings of the side walls and bottom
            may serve for heat dissipation.</p>
        <p id="p0028" num="0028">In one embodiment of the embedded consumable compartment, the embedded consumable
            compartment may have four closed side walls which are opposite each other, a closed bottom, and an open top
            into which at least one consumable can be inserted.</p>
        <p id="p0029" num="0029">In one embodiment of the embedded waste compartment, the embedded waste compartment may
            have four closed side walls which are opposite each other, a closed bottom, and an open top into which at
            least one waste container can be inserted.
            <!-- EPO <DP n="10"> -->
        </p>
        <p id="p0030" num="0030">In one embodiment of the embedded rack receiving compartment, the embedded rack
            receiving compartment may have three side walls and a closed bottom forming a rack slot with a closed rear
            end and an open front end into which one or multiple sample vessel racks or reagent container racks can be
            inserted.</p>
        <p id="p0031" num="0031">In one embodiment of the embedded sample processing device compartment, the embedded
            sample processing device compartment may have four side walls, a bottom with at least one opening, an open
            top into which at least one sample processing device can be mounted.</p>
        <p id="p0032" num="0032">In one embodiment of the single base plate, the single base plate further comprises at
            least one embedded support element. At least one of said embedded support element is selected from a group
            consisting of a cable channel, an air channel, a display frame, an identification device or sensor holder,
            an instrument interlock module, a latch-fit or snap-latch, or a combination thereof. The term "embedded
            support element" as used herein, means that the support element and the single base plate consist of one
            single formed piece. Accordingly, the number of construction components is further reduced compared to
            conventional constructions of laboratory instruments.</p>
        <p id="p0033" num="0033">In a further embodiment of the single base plate, the single base plate comprises at
            least one reference structure. The at least one reference structure comprises a geometric form for
            determining reference position information within the three-dimensional rectangular coordinate system of the
            laboratory instrument. The at least one reference structure can be a defined reference bolt or reference
            mark which is designed as a rectangular recesses, round recesses, cubic protrusion or cylindrical protrusion
            of the single base plate. The at least one reference structure of the single base plate is detectable by a
            reference structure detection device like a pressure sensor, an air pressure sensor, an optical sensor, a
            laser, an ultrasound sensor, or a combination thereof. Upon detection of the reference structure of the
            single base plate, reference position information within the interior of the laboratory instrument or
            laboratory system is determined and used for adjusting or calibrating the positioning of at the least one
            pipetting device or handling device of the laboratory instrument or laboratory system.</p>
        <p id="p0034" num="0034">In one embodiment of the laboratory instrument, the laboratory instrument additionally
            comprises at least one electrically conductive element. The at least one electrically conductive element is
            mounted on the single base plate. The electrically conductive element can be made of
            <!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> any conductive material and can have any geometric form and size. The term
            "electrically conductive" as used herein, means that the material of which the element is made of has the
            property to conduct an electrical current.</p>
        <p id="p0035" num="0035">In one embodiment of the at least one electrically conductive element, the at least one
            electrically conductive element comprises at least one reference structure. The at least one reference
            structure comprises a geometric form for determining reference position information within the
            three-dimensional rectangular coordinate system of the laboratory instrument. The at least one reference
            structure can be a defined reference bolt or reference mark which is designed as a rectangular recesses,
            round recesses, cubic protrusion or cylindrical protrusion of the electrically conductive element.</p>
        <p id="p0036" num="0036">In one embodiment of the at least one reference structure, the at least one reference
            structure can be defined as a through-hole of the electrically conductive element. The at least one
            reference structure of the electrically conductive element is detectable by a reference structure detection
            device like a conductive pipette tip, a conductive pipette nozzle, a conductive gripper finger, a pressure
            sensor, an air pressure sensor, an optical sensor, a laser, an ultrasound sensor, or a combination thereof.
            Upon detection of the reference structure, reference position information within the interior of the
            laboratory instrument or laboratory system is determined and used for adjusting or calibrating the
            positioning of the at least one pipetting device or handling device of the laboratory instrument or
            laboratory system as described further below.</p>
        <p id="p0037" num="0037">In a further embodiment of the at least one electrically conductive element, the at
            least one electrically conductive element comprises one or more electrically conductive sheets. At least one
            of the one or more electrically conductive sheets comprises at least one through-hole and the at least one
            through-hole is aligned with the open top of at least one embedded compartment of the single base plate. The
            form of the at least one through-hole is congruent with the open top of at least one embedded compartment so
            that consumables can be loaded/ unloaded into the embedded consumable compartment, a sample processing
            device in the embedded sample processing compartment can be accessed by the operator or pipetting/ handling
            device, a waste container can be loaded/ unloaded into the embedded waste compartment, or racks can be
            loaded/ unloaded into the embedded rack receiving compartment.
            <!-- EPO <DP n="12"> -->
        </p>
        <p id="p0038" num="0038">In a specific embodiment of the at least one electrically conductive element, the at
            least one electrically conductive element is made of aluminum.</p>
        <p id="p0039" num="0039">In one embodiment of the one or more electrically conductive sheets, the at least one
            through-hole is the least one reference structure. The through-hole may be rectangular and the two edges
            which are perpendicular to each other define the x and y values of the reference position information.
            Alternatively, the x and y values of the reference position information can also be defined with a round
            through-hole. The z value of the reference position information can be defined by the position of the
            electrically conductive sheet along the z direction. As the reference structure can be a through-hole which
            is aligned and congruent with the open top of an embedded consumable compartment there is enough free space
            for moving the reference structure detection device towards the edges of the through-hole without
            encountering any obstacles. This allows a safe and accurate detection of the reference structure.
            Furthermore, a space-saving design of the interior of the laboratory instrument is possible as no additional
            free space is necessary for moving the reference structure detection device towards the reference structure.
        </p>
        <p id="p0040" num="0040">In a further embodiment of the one or more electrically conductive sheets, the one or
            more electrically conductive sheets comprise at least one latch-fit or snap-latch. The latch-fit or
            snap-latch is located on the electrically conductive sheet so that consumables with corresponding counter
            snap-latches or latch-fits can be attached precisely and reversibly to the electrically conductive sheet.
            Thus, consumables can be easily loaded/ unloaded manually and at the same time the consumables like for

            vessel racks (69) or reagent container racks (70) prevent the accessibility to the at least one reference
            structure (50). In step a) (78) of the method the at least one transfer system (64) moves the pipetting
            device (60) or handling device towards the at least one reference structure (50). In step b) (80) of the
